Michaela:

First of all, I'd like to say that I found this barchart impressive and well defined.
I like the box surrounding the plot as well as the position of the plot overall in the page.
I have a few comments though:
- I like the fact that you removed any decimals from the ticks on your y-axis (useless in this exercice) but (and I also have the same problem on my barchart), the number of ticks keeps increasing with the frequency. Therefore, if the most frequent letters occurs 8 times, you will have 8 ticks (ranging from 1 to 8). 
- I think I would have positionned the legend elsewhere because in case of a high frequency towards the right of the x-axis, the bar and the legend would be stacked on top of each other.  Regarding the legend itself I really don't know if that's doable but I like the idea of adding 'sometimes y' to the legend only when there is a y in the text!
- I really like your tooltip mentionning the frequency and the letter on the bar.
- I like how you positionned the axis labels (letter and frequency).


Daniel:

The barchart looks really nice, I like the choice of the colors used. 
The textbox and the button are definitely a plus (I am wondering if the user could use both the textbox as well as typing in the URI?). 
Here are my comments:

Therefore if the most frequent letters occurs 8 times, you will have 8 ticks (ranging from 1 to 8).
- I think it is a bit confusing to automatically sort by values at the beginning of the plot and then you have to uncheck the box, I would rather let the user check the box if they want to sort based on the values first.
- The tooltip is well positioned and gives information about the count of the letter and therefore the use of a gridline is not necessary.  I think that an x-axis would have been helpfull though, I don't really like the white space between the y-axis and the first bar on the left.


Weiwei:

The plot looks nice and I also like the description part of it (even though we are not judged on that).  You even included a link to the source code, it reminds me a blog post of Mike Bostock!
A few comments though regarding the plot:
- I think you should remove the decimals from the ticks (quite unlikely to have less than 1 unit).
- I like your tooltip. The information displayed is clear and eye-catchy, I would maybe change for a small triangle below the tip (it looks a little bit weird but that's being picky).
- I like the opacity of the horizontal gridlines, I would maybe use a darker x and y axis...
